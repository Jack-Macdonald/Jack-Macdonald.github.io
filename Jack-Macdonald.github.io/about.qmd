I am a masters student at the University of Texas at Dallas study data science and social data analytics.

I graduated with a degree in Political Science from UTD in the fall of 2022 and continued working on my masters degree.

This site is currently being used to post assignments for a class, if you found this outside of that reason, congrats. You found me.
